## INTRODUCTION:

Scenario-Based Report Development involves crafting reports based on simulated or real-world situations. These scenarios can represent challenges, incidents, case studies, or strategic decisions relevant to a subject area (e.g., business, education, healthcare).

Diverse Prompting Techniques are varied types of questions, cues, or instructions used to elicit comprehensive responses. These techniques help structure the analysis, direct focus, and encourage critical thinking.

## Objectives

•	Encourage critical thinking and problem-solving

•	Enhance decision-making skills

•	Support deep reflection using targeted prompts

•	Improve writing and reporting quality

•	Simulate real-world application of theoretical knowledge

## Types of Prompting Techniques

1.	Descriptive Prompts

Ask the learner to describe a scenario or process.

Example: “Describe what happened in the scenario involving the cybersecurity breach.”

2.	Analytical Prompts
   
Encourage analysis of causes, effects, or relationships.

Example: “Why did the customer service failure occur? What were the contributing factors?”

3.	Evaluative Prompts

Promote judgment about actions or outcomes.

Example: “Evaluate the response of the management team. Was it effective?”

4.	Predictive Prompts
   
Ask the user to anticipate outcomes or future implications.

Example: “What are the likely consequences if the same strategy is used again?”

5.	Reflective Prompts
   
Encourage personal insight or lessons learned.

Example: “What would you do differently if you were the project lead?”

6.	Creative/Scenario Expansion Prompts
   
Prompt the user to extend or modify the scenario.

Example: “How would the situation change if the budget was doubled?

## Scenario

A travel company is creating a report to inform their customers about sustainable travel practices.

The company wants a section explaining how tourists can reduce their environmental impact.

We’ll apply three types of prompting to see how the responses vary in depth, focus, and clarity.
Example Scenario (Education Sector)

Scenario: A high school is seeing a sharp decline in student performance after switching to hybrid learning.


## Prompts Used:

•	Descriptive: Describe the changes in student attendance and engagement.

•	Analytical: What are the root causes of the performance drop?

•	Evaluative: Was the hybrid model implemented effectively?

•	Reflective: What would you recommend to the school board?

## Prompts and Responses

1. Direct Prompting
   
Prompt: “Explain how tourists can reduce their environmental impact when traveling.”

Response:

"Tourists can reduce their environmental impact by using public transportation instead of renting cars, staying in eco-friendly accommodations, minimizing plastic use, conserving water, and respecting local wildlife and natural habitats. Sustainable travel also includes supporting local businesses and reducing energy consumption wherever possible."

Analysis:

- Strengths: Provides a quick, high-level overview of practices.
- Limitations: Lacks specific examples, context, or actionable details. The response may seem too general for a report aimed at educating customers.

2. Iterative Prompting
   
Initial Prompt: “Explain how tourists can reduce their environmental impact when traveling.”
Follow-Up Prompt: “Provide more examples and specific actions tourists can take.” 

Response:

"Tourists can reduce their environmental impact by choosing eco-friendly transportation options like trains, buses, or electric vehicles when available. Staying at accommodations certified for environmental responsibility, such as LEED-certified hotels or eco-lodges, can also reduce energy use. 

Packing reusable items like water bottles, bags, and utensils minimizes plastic waste. Tourists should conserve resources by turning off lights and air conditioning when leaving their rooms, using towels and linens for multiple days, and taking shorter showers. Supporting local and small businesses, especially those with sustainable practices, also reduces the carbon footprint associated with international supply chains."

Analysis:

- Strengths: The follow-up prompt encourages more detail and specific examples, making the response more useful and engaging for readers.
  
- Limitations: Requires multiple interactions to achieve a comprehensive answer, which can be time-consuming if many refinements are needed.

3. Guided Prompting
   
Prompt: “Write a paragraph for a travel report that explains five specific actions tourists can take to reduce their environmental impact. Use a friendly and informative tone.”

Response:

"When traveling, tourists can reduce their environmental impact in a few easy ways. First, opt for public transportation, biking, or walking over renting a car, which lowers emissions. Second, choose eco-friendly hotels that implement green practices, like energy-efficient lighting and water-saving fixtures. Third, pack a reusable water bottle and avoid single-use plastics. Fourth, take shorter showers and skip daily towel changes to save water and energy. Finally, support local businesses and farmers' markets, which reduces the carbon footprint from food and product imports. By making these small changes, travelers can enjoy their trips while protecting the environment."

Analysis:

- Strengths: Highly targeted, clear, and organized response. The specified tone makes the text engaging and customer-friendly.
  
- Limitations: Limited to exactly what the prompt specifies, which could omit details if they aren’t requested directly.

## Conclusion

Guided prompting delivered the most polished response aligned with the goal of informingcustomers in a friendly and structured way, making it ideal for  customer-focused reports.
However, iterative prompting was helpful for adding detail when needed, while direct prompting was quick for generating general ideas.
